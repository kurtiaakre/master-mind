ok, I have save this overview as a .md file - and it looks good. Now, let's think about the screen presentation. I want to be as flexible as possible - so I want my game to be run in a Window that can: 1. made full screen - and back, and of course minimized (this is default - right), 2. generally be resized to any size down to a minimum size of let's say 128x64 pixels. All components (text & graphic) should be scaled based on the total screen area - but only to a certain limit, let's say 1:1 scale is 1920x1080 and if the device starting the game is using this resolution (or lower) the game should be opened in full screen mode. Maximum scaling should be double, and minimum should be half. If needed, functioning scroll bars should appear. In the upper left corned I want a .jpg picture displayed. Below that there should be a text area where stats will be written - that area should be same size as the picture area. To the right of these 2 areas should the Master Mind board be displayed, either in 2D or 3D - the area should be roughly 3 times as wide as the other 2 areas, and the same height as the 2 other areas combined. All around the Window there should be a 10% "empty" area for tidyness. Notice that I say the board will be displayed either as a 2D or 3D - so we need to use a module for graphics that can do 2D and 3D (and switch during runtime). Ok, write the code now - produce the main code file and implement what I describe and create the "game loop" - but use a "wait for keypress" after the gui is displayed. Path to the image is: ./resources/MasterMind.jpg
