Your right, it's that good old game! We are starting now (python it is) - and I think it can be usefull to just go for the presentation = screen first. I will try to divide that parts of the game(code) in separate modules, probably also files. But the main module might just as well include ALL the output code. So that we will end up with a main module that contain: initialization of program, presentation of gui, interation of choosing game mode: Judge/Guesser=Human/Human, AI/Human,Human/AI,AI/AI (the 2 last ones is kind of pointless from a game perspective - but interesting for coding/techonolgical perspective), updating of gui, initiate interaction (asking for guess if guesser is player, asking for judgement if judge is player), presentation of results(either judgement or guesses), validation of win/loss (4 black, 12 row used without 4 black) and concluding the game, exit the game, then we will have a second module for player making a judgement (nothing supplied, returns a judgement), AI making a judgement (supply guess - return judgement), player making a guess (nothing supplied, returns a guess), AI making a guess (supply a list of all guesses & judgements, returns guess) - I guess these generally will be procedures.. For now I don't want you to supply ANY code - but can you format my text into something more readable so we can put it into a text file. I probably feed this to you everytime we start a working session on the project - so probably it will contain what we have done and what we plan to do - and change as we work.
