Mastermind - 24.09.2025 - Kurt I. Aakre

This will be my first real project, and the purpose of this prooject is in ranked order:

1. Train on using Git & Github
2. Learn to use graphics in Python
3. Learn more Python and good practices
4. Create a Master Mind game in 3 steps:
	1. No AI - just a board and input from a Master and a Player - only judging winning/loosing conditions (4 black prongs/12 rows)
	2. Master as AI - will judge guesses and decide on white/black/no prongs
	3. Player as AI - will guess and try to reason from feedback

- Will use graphics, a horisontal board and include the picture of Gentleman and Hot Lady created by Grok
- Will use modular achitecture: a game loop which calls Player and Master modules
- Will try to use object oriented code - if it will be practical
- Will use AI for coding

Time will tell how far I will come in this project.
