Mastermind - 08.09.2025 - Kurt I. Aakre

This will be first first real project
The purpose of this prooject is in ranked order:

1. Train on using Git & Github
2. Learn to use graphics in Python
3. Learn more Python and good practices
4. Create a Mastermind game in 3 steps:
	1. No AI - just a board and input from a Master and a Player - only judging winning/loosing conditions (4 black prongs/12 rows)
	2. Master as AI - will judge guesses and decide on white/black/no prongs
	3. Player as AI - will guess and try to reason from feedback

Will use graphics, a horisontal board and include the picture of Gentleman and hot lady created by Grok
Will use modular achitecture: a game loop which calls Player and Master modules.
Will try to use object oriented code - if it will be practical
